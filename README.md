The Osprette V3
=============

The Osprette V3 is the 3rd revision of the [Osprette][osprette]. It's a 34-key unibody that runs on any pro-micro compatible daughterboard. It comes with bluetooth support by way of battery terminals and a power switch. It is direct solder (AKA no hotswap) for maximum stability of the switches.
